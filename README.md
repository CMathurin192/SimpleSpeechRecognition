# SimpleSpeechRecognition
A simple script that uses speech recognition to control computer keyboard inputs.

This is code that takes in audio from a microphone to convert it into text. I made it because it's annoying to move
my hand to follow along in slideshows during class when I'm sitting comfortably.

Now, of course, I couldn't really use this during class. I'd look like a maniac telling my computer to advance and go back. But outside of class, this can definitely be useful.
